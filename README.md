I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, I refuse to associate with white guilt ridden soyboys, while doing so.

If you are not a soyboy/soylent grin user/cuck/beta male, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
If you are...well - biology already punished you enough, I can only sit far away and be amused.
